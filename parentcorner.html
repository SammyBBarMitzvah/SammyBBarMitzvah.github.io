            <p class="subtitle is-4" style="text-justify:auto">Parents, we are very much looking forward to having your child attend Sammy’s Bar Mitzvah on October 20<sup>th</sup>! For those of you who are unaware of the customs surrounding a Bar Mitzvah, we thought we would answer a few frequently asked
                questions.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="subtitle is-4"><strong><i>What is a Bar Mitzvah?</i></strong><br>When a Jewish boy reaches the age of thirteen, he is recognized as an adult in the Jewish community. One great honor that accompanies becoming an adult is the opportunity to lead a Shabbat
                service. Sammy has studied the Hebrew language for the past seven years and has been preparing for this honor and privilege for the past few months.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p class="subtitle is-4" style="text-justify: auto"><strong><i>What should my child do at the service?</i></strong><br>The service will begin at 9:00 am, however, your child does not need to arrive until 9:45 am. Upon arrival, they should quietly take a seat in the sanctuary, with boys making
                sure to pick up a kippah (traditional Jewish head covering) before entering the sanctuary. Although this is a religious service, your child will not be called upon to do anything more than observe and perhaps read along with the Congregation,
                if he or she is comfortable doing so. Girls should wear a dress or skirt (no bare shoulders) and boys should wear nice pants and a collared shirt (no jeans, please). Cell phones must be turned off before entering the synagogue. The service
                should conclude around 12:00 pm, followed by a Kiddush luncheon afterward. Your child is welcome to stay and grab a bite to eat or leave when the service concludes – it’s entirely up to them!</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p class="subtitle is-4"><strong><i>What if my child is unable to attend the service?</strong></i><br> We understand that children often have pre-existing committments on Saturday mornings, so if they are unable to attend the Bar Mitzvah service, they are still welcome
                to join us at the party on Saturday evening.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="subtitle is-4"><strong><i>Anything I should know about the party?</i></strong><br>Yes! The party starts at 7:00 pm and your child should come ready to have a great time! We have planned an awesome experience with lots of music, dancing, games, food, and
                FUN for everyone! All guests are encouraged to wear sports jerseys (if they have them), to go along with our party’s football theme. If your child does not have a sports jersey - that’s ok - they can wear any dressy casual attire that
                makes them comfortable and will fit right in!</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p class="subtitle is-4"><strong><i>When is the party over?</i></strong><br>You should anticipate picking up your child anywhere from 11:30 pm – 12:00 am, depending on the how much fun they're having! We recognize not everyone is a partying night owl, so please stay
                in contact with your child throughout the evening in case they wish to leave early.</p><br>
            <p class="subtitle is-4">We look forward to sharing this event with your child!!</p>
