            <br> <br>
            <p class="subtitle">Dear Parents,</p>
            <p>We are very much looking forward to having your child attend <br> Sammy’s Bar Mitzvah on October 20<sup>th</sup>! For those of you who have never <br> attended a Bar Mitzvah, we thought we would answer a <br> few frequently asked questions.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong><i>What is a Bar Mitzvah?</i></strong><br>When a Jewish child reaches the age of thirteen, he is<br> recognized as an adult in the Jewish community. One great<br> honor that accompanies becoming an adult is the opportunity<br> to lead
                a Shabbat service. Sammy has studied the Hebrew<br> language for the past seven years and has been preparing for<br> this honor and privilege for the past few months.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p><strong><i>What should my child do at the service</i></strong><br>The service will begin at 9:00am, however, your child does not <br> have to arrive until 9:45am. Upon arrival, they should quietly<br> take a seat in the sanctuary, although
                the boys should make sure to <br>pick up a kippah (traditional Jewish head covering) before <br> entry to the sanctuary. Although this is a religious service,<br> your child will not be called upon to do anything more than<br> observe
                and perhaps read along with the Congregation, if he or<br> she is comfortable doing so. Girls should wear a dress or skirt<br> (no bare shoulders) and boys should wear nice pants and a<br> collared shirt (no jeans, please). Cell phones
                must be turned off
                <br> before entering the synagogue. The service should conclude<br> around 12pm, followed by a Kiddush luncheon afterwards. Your<br> child is welcome to stay and grab a bite to eat or leave when<br> the service concludes – it’s entirely
                up to them!</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p><strong><i>Anything I should know about the party?</i></strong><br>Yes! The party starts at 7pm and your child should come ready<br> to have a great time! We have planned for an awesome experience <br> with lots of music, dancing, games, food,
                and FUN for everyone! <br> All guests are encouraged to wear sports jerseys (if they have<br> them), to go along with our party’s football theme. If your child<br> does not have a sports jersey - that’s ok - they can wear any<br> dressy
                casual attire that makes them comfortable and will fit<br> right in!</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p><strong><i>When is the party over?</i></strong><br>You should anticipate picking up your child anywhere from <br> 11:15pm – 12:00am, depending on the how much fun they're <br>having! We recognize not everyone is a partying night owl,<br> so
                please stay in contact with your child throughout the<br> evening in case they wish to leave early.</p><br>
            <p>We look forward to sharing this event with your child!!</p>
