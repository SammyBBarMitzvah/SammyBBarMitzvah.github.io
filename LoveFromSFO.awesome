Hey Josh, 

So sorry Val, Liam, and I won't be able to make it, but of a trek from San Francisco. 
We had a great time a few years ago with you and your family, feels great to be invited again :) 

We will be in the DC area the first week of November, hope to see you and yours then.

Sincerely,
Sean & Val & Liam
The Gonzalez & Coffman Family
The Beautiful Nerd Family (I think that one makes the most sense)
